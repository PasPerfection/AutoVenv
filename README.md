# AutoVenv

This vscode extension automatically creates a virtual environment for the project. It also adds the virtual environment to the python path and activates the virtual environment by sourcing the virtual environment's bin/activate file in the .venv directory. When the virtual environment is activated, it will be automatically activated when the project is opened in vscode. No manual intervention is required. Happy coding!
